I created this script to analyze data within the Heroes of Pymoli game.
Among the things I analyzed were total players, demographics regarding age and gender, top spenders, as well as most popular items for purchase.
After running this script I can tell a few things about this data:
- The majority of players making purchases are male. Specifically, males make up about 84% of the total players making purchases.
- About 45% of the players fall within the age group of 20-24. The oldest player is 45 and the youngest player is 7.
- The two most popular items include Final Critic and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm.
- These two most popular items are also the most profitable.
